hanz0

hanz0 is a lightweight secret and leak scanner written in Go. It reads URLs from stdin, fetches each URL, and searches for strings that match a set of regular expressions (indicating potential secrets or tokens). It color-codes findings by severity (critical, medium, low) and can optionally save results to a JSON file.



Installation

  

    Clone the Repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/hanz0.git
    cd hanz0go build main.go -o hanz0
    This produces an executable named hanz0.

You need Go installed on your system (version 1.17+ recommended). No additional libraries are requiredâ€”hanz0 only uses the Go standard library.
Usage
Basic Usage

    Prepare a list of URLs in a text file, one URL per line (e.g., urls.txt).
    
    Pipe the file into hanz0:

    cat urls.txt | ./hanz0

    If nothing is piped in, the tool will display usage/help text.

Flags / Options

    -threads (default 5): Number of concurrent HTTP requests.
    -severity: High,Medium or Low with the -s flag
    -timeout (default 5): HTTP request timeout in seconds.
    -verbose: Prints additional messages, including which URL is currently being scanned.
    -json <filename>: Writes all findings to a JSON file.
    -useragent <ua string> (default GoLeakScanner/1.0): Sets the User-Agent header.

Use -h to see all flags:

    ./hanz0 -h

Examples

Scan URLs with Default Settings:

    cat urls.txt | ./hanz0
    Reads URLs from urls.txt
    Prints secrets found in color-coded format
    No JSON output

Scan Verbosely, 10 Threads, Write JSON:

    cat urls.txt | ./hanz0 -threads 10 -verbose -json results.json

    cat urls.txt | ./hanz0 -useragent "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; hanz0/1.2)" -timeout 8

Customization

    Patterns: The tool uses an internal list of regex patterns stored in the code. Modify the embeddedPatternsStr and/or the classifyPattern function in main.go to add new patterns or adjust the severity classification.
    Color Output: Adjust the ANSI codes or classification logic in the severityToColor function to change how results are color-coded.
    Logging: The severity and color assignment is a simple demonstration. For more complex risk-based classification, expand the classifyPattern logic.
